# WinForms Splash Screen Manager - Interact with the Splash Screen by sending commands

This example adds a Progress Bar control to a Splash Screen and updates it dynamically by sending commands from the Splash Screen Manager.

The Splash Screen Manager displays Splash Screens in a separate thread. The Splash Screen Manager implements the command mechanism that allows you to interact with Splash Screens. Use the `SplashScreenManager.SendCommand` method to send and process commands (by overriding the `SplashScreen.ProcessCommand` method).
